        "    \"What is the expected resale value after 3–5 years of Bolero Neo Plus?\": \"Resale holds strong at 65–75% of original price after 3 years (e.g., a ₹11 lakh model resells for ₹7–8 lakh), thanks to its rugged build and demand in commercial segments.\",\n",
        "    \"What is the seating comfort like for long journeys in Bolero Neo Plus?\": \"The 2+3+4 layout provides ample space for 9 adults in city or short drives, with good legroom in the first two rows and armrests.
